<h2> What Is AI</h2>
<p>in the simplest terms, AI which stands for artificial intelligence 
 refers to systems or machines that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks and can iteratively 
improve themselves based on the information they collect.</p>
<h1>Things you can do with AI</h1>
<p>Voice assistants, such as Google Assistant, Alexa, and Siri, are the greatest AI examples in real life. 
    hey take your inquiry via voice, process it with your phone's Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing 
    technologies, and then deliver the results as speech or text.</p>
    <p>1) Drive you around in relative safety.
        2) Book things for you by phone.
        3) Write marketing language which outperforms that written by humans.
        4) Understand you (most of the time)
        5) Predict which movies/TV shows/songs/products you'll like with a reasonable degree of accuracy.</p>

             are a major part of business. This includes professional services, medical imaging, retail, travel, e-commerce, insurance, financial institutions,
             healthcare, education, and government agencies.</p>

 Is AI Important
                <h1>Why Is AI Important</h1>
                <p>Today, the amount of data that is generated, by both humans and machines, far outpaces
                     humans' ability to absorb, interpret, and make complex decisions based on that data. Artificial 
                     intelligence forms the basis for all computer learning and is the future of all complex decision making.</p>
